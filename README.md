# Frontend Assignment

Hi, Catalin here.

First of all thank you for this cool exercise & opportunity.
I have to mention some things:

- Unfortunately, I haven't done any tests so far at previous jobs.
- There is a lot of room for improvement especially in terms of appearance & TS types
- I've never worked with Styled Components before, so I used a separate CSS file. Anyway, it looks really cool from what I've seen :)
- The solution with countries stored in memory I think it's fine in this small app. However, when we work with big numbers of data we should query/GET that specific item.

## Description

Please complete a small application based on the UI mockup provided below.

## UI (mockup)

![Main page](/preview1.png)

## Stack

- _TypeScript_
- _React.js_
- _Styled Components_ for styling
- _Apollo client_ for fetching data from GraphQL API
- _Jest/React-testing-library_ for testing

For other technologies please pick the one you like unless you can explain the choice.

## Instruction

1. Please make a Code Review of _Continents.tsx_ and _Continents.test.tsx_. Create file _CODEREVIEW.md_ and put your thoughts inside.
2. Remove _Continents_ component and _README_ preview from _App.tsx_.
3. Fix test in _Continents.test.tsx_.
4. Create Main page, based on mockup that displays Countries based on [this public GraphQL API](https://countries.trevorblades.com). If you are not familiar with GraphQL, you can check _Continents.tsx_.
5. Please write tests for this page.

## Workflow

1. Signin (signup) to the CodeSandbox platform and fork this project
2. Complete the project based on the requirements
3. Once it's complete please send the link to your fork to [n.klaasse@cvmaker.nl](mailto:n.klaasse@cvmaker.nl)
